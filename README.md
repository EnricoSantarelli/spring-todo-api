# ðŸ“˜Santander Bootcamp 2023 - Fullstack Java + Angular


This project is an integral part of the study track within the Santander Bootcamp 2023 - Fullstack Java + Angular. 

The bootcamp offers a comprehensive curriculum designed to equip participants with the skills and knowledge required to excel in both Java backend development and Angular frontend development. 

This particular project serves as a study of the Java framework: Spring Boot. I developed a API REST to be consumed by a task organization app. Additionally, the API was uploaded to the cloud via railway.
